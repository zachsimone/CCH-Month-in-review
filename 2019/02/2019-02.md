# February 2019 month in review - Notes

Note: Not strictly covering the last month only, as it's been three months since we've had a month in review at CocoaHeads.

## Apple developer news
* Mac App Analytics Now Available in App Store Connect. https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12132018b
* Changes for App Store Connect/Apple Developer organisation teams. Some roles and permissions have changed. If you were part of a development team on the developer website, but didn't have access to App Store Connect, this has probably changed, as permissions are now set for both. Managing teams and roles is now done entirely in App Store Connect. https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01182019a
* Apple are also requiring all developer program members to have two-factor authentication enabled on their account by the end of February. This shows they expect that accounts belong to an individual, and aren't shared. https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/13/apple-developer-two-factor-requirement/
* Most people have a separate developer account to their personal Apple ID, but it looks like it is possible to add a second account to the same iOS device specifically for 2FA. Alternatively, you could use SMS 2FA, though this is less secure. https://kylesethgray.com/adding-a-separate-developer-account-to-your-ios-device/
* Though, the 2FA setup isn't restored, so it's probably best to not do this if you only log into one device, as you could loose the trusted device if you restore it. https://twitter.com/mxswd/status/1095908576332107782
* A [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/iphone-session-replay-screenshots/) report showed that popular iPhone apps were using analytics frameworks to record the screens of unknowing users while they were using apps. The screen recordings didn’t necessarily block out sensitive info such as credit card details. Shortly after, Apple sent an email to developers in violation of this policy saying to either disclose what they were doing, or to remove the screen recording functionality from the app, or else the app would be removed from the App Store. https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/apple-glassbox-apps/ 
* The Swift Community Podcast started, explained as a podcast "for the Swift community, by the Swift community." It's meant to have different guests, producers, and editors each episode, and ideas, suggestions, or an expression of interest in volunteering can be coordinated through the [show's GitHub](https://github.com/SwiftCommunityPodcast/podcast) repo, by raising issues or opening pull requests. Chris Lattner was on the first couple of episodes. https://www.swiftcommunitypodcast.org
* Betas - Xcode 10.2, iOS 12.2, macOS 10.14.4, watchOS 5.2, tvOS 12.2, Swift 5.0.
* Swift 5.0 highlights - ABI stability (resulting in smaller app binary sizes, as the Swift standard libraries are no longer shipped inside the app bundle), `isMultiple(of: Int)` on integers (saves using the old `%` syntax), `Result` type, `compactMapValues` higher order function which essentially combines the existing `filter` and `map` operations.
* CocoaPods 1.6 released, after a [6 month](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.6.0-beta/) beta.
* Felix Krause (creator of Fastlane) announced he will no longer be working at Google on Fastlane. Tweetstorm: https://twitter.com/KrauseFx/status/1095746152773967872.  
* WWDC, Apple's annual developer conference, is rumoured to be held the week of 3rd June. https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/12/wwdc-2019-dates-june-3-7-san-jose/

## Apple news
* In their first press release of the year, Tim Cook issued a letter to investors, and Apple revised their revenue guidance for the quarter (which turned out to be a good call, as earnings were lower than initially expected) blaming everything from economic weakness in China, to unfavourable foreign exchange rates, slower iPhone upgrade cycles, and more. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/
* Apple released Smart Battery Cases for the 2018 iPhone models - iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR. https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/15/iphone-smart-battery-cases/
* A bug in Group FaceTime was found which allowed someone to hear and see the person on the other side of the call before they'd picked up. Apple disabled FaceTime a few hours after this news story went mainstream, and released iOS 12.1.4 and a supplementary update to macOS 10.14.3 the following week to patch the bug. https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-bug-hear-audio/
* Is pretty ironic that it happened a few weeks after this billboard was put up at CES. https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/05/apple-privacy-billboard-vegas-ces/
* Apple are supposedly holding a media event on 25th March. We may or may not see updated AirPods, but it'll mostly be focused on services - such as a new [Apple News subscription service](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-event-march-2019-news), and possibly the launch of the long-rumoured [video streaming service](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/apple-is-said-to-invite-hollywood-stars-to-video-service-launch) which will supposedly rival Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video. https://mashable.com/article/apple-plans-march-event-for-news-and-video-services/#CFaLf.7uWaqh
* Angela Ahrendts, Apple's SVP of retail, will be stepping down in April for "new personal and professional pursuits," and her role is being taken over by Deirdre O'Brien, who will lead retail and people. https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/05/angela-ahrendts-departing-apple-deirdre-o-brien/

## General tech news
* New emojis! Emoji 12.0 (the 2019 new emoji set) was announced. 230 of them in fact. Including yawning face, pinching hand, as well as flamingo, sloth, and skunk (my favourites). Oh and there's a "Maté" emoji. Though not the Aussie kind of mate. The new emojis also have a focus on accessibility, with new emoji of people in wheelchairs, people with probing canes, mechanical arms, hearing aids, and deaf people. https://blog.emojipedia.org/230-new-emojis-in-final-list-for-2019/
* Microsoft Office is now available for download on the Mac App Store. It's a nicer way to install and update Office 365 when compared to the annoying Microsoft installer helper tool that they've used for years. https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18196087/microsoft-office-apple-mac-app-store-download
* The Slack logo. It changed. People on the Internet were upset. https://slackhq.com/say-hello-new-logo
* Facebook were caught abusing the Apple enterprise developer distribution program. They were distributing a rebranded version of the Onavo Protect VPN app using their enterprise certificate, and paying these people $20/month in gift cards as compensation. This is after the app was taken off the App Store last year. The app was used for Facebook "research" and it intercepts all of a users network traffic, allowing Facebook to see everything people are doing on their phone - whether it be in a Facebook app or not. They were also targeting teenagers, to make this even more sketchy. https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/
* Apple revoked Facebook's enterprise distribution certificate for a couple of days as punishment, meaning a bunch of internal apps broke. It's since been restored, but distribution of the VPN app on iOS has stopped. https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/facebook-and-google-offered-gift-cards-for-root-level-access-to-ios-users-data/
* While this was all happening, Google admitted to doing the same thing through a similar app. They pulled it when news of the Facebook story broke, but also had their enterprise distribution certificate revoked temporarily. https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/googles-also-peddling-a-data-collector-through-apples-back-door/
* Spotify bought Gimlet and Anchor, for a [combined $340 million USD](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/), in a bid to have more control over the podcast market. This is another step towards trying to have large players in an industry that's typically been quite open and never had too much power lie with a single company. The best thing you can do is listen to podcasts that aren't exclusive to a single platform, and use a podcast player that supports an open market for podcasting - such as [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com) or [Overcast](http://overcast.fm). Even the [Apple Podcasts app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029) is okay for now. https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/spotify-doubles-down-on-podcasts/
* Amazon bought Eero, and people are worried about what this means for privacy. I'm sure eventually Amazon would love to snoop on the network traffic of Eero customers, which would allow them to deliver even better targeted advertising when these people next visit Amazon. https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/amazon-eero-privacy/amp/
* Jack Dorsey has been on a media tour, giving interviews, and appearing on many podcasts including Joe Rogan and Sam Harris' shows. Twitter is known for having a lot of problems - particularly around harassment - and doing little about it. They're also known for moving slowly, being mostly talk and taking very little action. Dorsey certainly seems aware of a lot of the issues, but until Twitter takes action it's all just for show. https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195245/jack-dorsey-twitter-media-tour-2019
